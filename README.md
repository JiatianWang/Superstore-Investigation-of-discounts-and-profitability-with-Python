# Superstore-Investigation-of-discounts-and-profitability-with-Python

## Context:
In 2014, the profit ratio went down significantly from 18 % to 10% with an overall decrease rate of 44%. Therefore, I investigate the truth of whether there is something wrong with the discount promotion plan.

## Research questions:
1. Is there any relationship between discounted sales and profits?
2. How much the company is profiting or losing based on discounted sales?
3. If there are opportunities for efficiencies with respect to how discounts are handled?

## Summary of results:
1. Discounts seem to boost Sales but Profits suffer
2. There is no strong correlation between the geography of sales and profits
3. The proportion of discounts needs to be adjusted
